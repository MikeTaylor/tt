Hiya Thomas,

I've fetched your hacked version of my Tetris -- thanks for making it
more widely available.  Just two things: (1) what do I have to do to
enable the colour support?  It comes up in balck-and-white when I run
it in an xterm; and (2) could you please put my email address,
<mirk@ssl.co.uk>, back on the main screen, after my name?

Thanks,

the environment variable "TERM" must be set to "linux". i'm searching for
a solution of this problem. at the moment the best way is to run it on
a standard text-console. the next version will - at least - include this
information.

no problem. i also have to make some other changes (for example, my email-
address and the address of the "official" website have changed)... i only
need some time.
i'll send you an email, when the new version and it's new website are
available.

uhmmm... sorry. my english is very bad. :-[
