Release 14.1 (Tue Oct 18 18:14:56 BST 2005)
     --	The form() function in "form.c" (declared in "form.h") now
	uses ANSI-style <stdarg.h> instead of old-style <varargs.h>,

     --	"util.c" now includes <term.h> to avoid a compiler warning
	when tgetstr() is used undeclared.
     --	"screen.c" now includes <string.h> to avoid a compiler warning when
	strlen() is used undeclared.
     --	New material on the end of the "Testimonial" file.
