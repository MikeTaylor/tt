Unsolicited testimonial from cadp53@ccsun.strath.ac.uk (14th June 1991)

	"It's a fiend to play well!  So fast!  It's now twice as
	 popular as the other tetris's I installed!  Take a bow!"

T3 concept by Harvey "Max" Thompson (harveyt@sco.com)

Things to do:
(*)  Fix email addresses to say mirk@ssl.co.uk throughout
(*)  Fix four games to use four separate high-score files
(*)  Clarify by using a single struct representing game-type
(*)  Consider re-introducing flush_keyboard() calls
(*)  Add left-to-right dropping startup flag (or key?)
(*)  Fix argument-parsing to use getopt()
(*)  Fix to determine game-type from argv[0]
(*)  Bring documentation up to date
(*)  Send it all off to GNU and LINUX.

And Harv says:
	You could update README to mention who actually wrote it.  You
	also have to edit tt.c to change the SCORE stuff.  Perhaps it
	should be a Makefile flag (so you only have to edit one file).
	An explanation of the LOCKF define and LOCK_FILE would also
	be helpful here.
